<h3>This choropleth map shows the average annual air emmisions by county in the Southeastern region of the United States. This map is based on 2018 data of greenhouse gas emissions into the air for states in the southeastern region of the U.S. (Region 4). This data comes from the EPA through the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Emissions data were reported for each facility and categorized by county boundaries. I was interested in this data because I was curious to see the emissions rates of North Carolina and the surrounding states and if there were any geographic trends that could be seen from this display of data.</h3>

<h3>Although there are no clear geographic trends in the data, the large discrepancies between counties in the amount of greenhouse gasses being emitted are clear. This can be seen in the way the data has been categorized. The quantile categorization divides the dataset into ranges containing an equal number of values (greenhouse gas emitting facilities). The tan colored states do not produce emissions on an industrial scale at all, while the darkest red counties emit between 4 and 200 thousand pounds of greenhouse gasses annually on average. This map could be used to determine future plans for the regulation of industrial greenhouse gas emissions, and it is a useful visual tool to understand that industrial air emissions are not a problem of one region or state, but instead a nationwide and global issue. </h3>
