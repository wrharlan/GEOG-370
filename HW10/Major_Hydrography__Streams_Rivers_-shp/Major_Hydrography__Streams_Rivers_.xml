            <abstract>The NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, developed this digital Major Hydrography data to enhance planning, siting and impact analysis in areas directly affecting surface waters consisting of streams and rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and shorelines. The data is a subset of the 1:24,000-scale detailed hydrography data. This file is updated as changes occur.</abstract>
            <purpose>This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) where information on general hydrographic features is needed.</purpose>
            <supplinf>system filename: hydromaj file size = 6.40 mb Revisions and updates to this layer include: 3.) Previous 1:100,000-scale version was used to select hydro features from 1:24,000-scale coverage to create a new subset of the detailed hydro for purposes of larger scale mapping and making additional attributes available in the major hydrography coverage. Arcs and polygons were created as major_hydro_arcs.shp and major_hydro_polys.shp. In the shapefile version of the polygons, label = 216 was excluded (water offshore) to make the shapefile more suitable for cartographic purposes. 2.) filename: hydromaj299 The February 9, 1999 updates include: a.) Projecting the data from NAD27 datum, State Plane projection, units of measure feet TO: NAD83 DATUM, State Plane PROJECTION, UNITS OF MEASURE METERS. This was done to comply with the NC Geographic Information Coordinating Council's "Statement of Direction for North Carolina Corporate Geographic Database Horizontal Reference, Datum and Unit of Measure". This reprojecting was done in various ways depending on the data type and content. Vector data was projected using the 'project' command in ESRI's Arc software and topology was cleaned and built based on coverage needs. Raster data was projected using ESRI's Grid module and various steps as applicable. b.) Replaced the lake boundary for Falls Lake. Corrected lake boundary digitized from US Army Corps of Engineers 51.5 foot contour overlay that was transferred onto 1:24,000-scale topo sheets. (The original lake contours were surveyed incorrectly and the lake level has since been raised to the correct 251.5 ft level.) c.) Added more detailed stream annotation (anno level 1 - primary streams; anno level 2 - secondary streams). 1.) filename: hydromaj997 The original version was dated September 1997. (perviousl named majhydro) Any previous versions were not offical database releases.</supplinf>

            <attraccr>All attribute codes have been extensively edited for accuracy by the associated agency. Stream codes, classifications and use support - NCDENR, DWQ; Linework, DLG code - NCCGIA. Attribute accuracy is considered high.</attraccr>
        </attracc>
        <logic>Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for arc and polygon topology using the "build" command. The data set was then cleaned with a fuzzy tolerance of 1 meter. Topology has not been edited since the last build or clean.</logic>
        <complete>These data represent the locations and identities of surface waters consisting of streams and rivers, lakes, ponds, and shorelines, as depicted on USGS 1:24,000-scale digital line graphs and supplemented to reflect hydrographic features classified by the state but not represented on the original DLG linework. Each stream reach is labeled with stream classification and use support information. All stream segments are approved by DWQ whether they are the original DWQ boundaries or changes to original boundaries.</complete>

                <procdesc>1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph Files were taken from the USGS and refined. Post DLG and data refinements include: a) Translation of DLG to ARC/INFO data format b) Review and correction for incompleteness and/or incorrect DLG attributes c) Internal and external (in-progress) coordinate edgematching of features along map edges d) Addition of hydrographic features as required by DWQ for stream classifications e) Addition of hydrographic attributes as identified in attribute table specifications f) Deletion of all swamp apparent limits and area label points DWQ Stream classification index numbers were marked onto 1:24,000-scale vellum plots of the 1:100,000-scale hydrography. The index numbers were added to the digital files on screen. Where streams were coded by DWQ but not present in the digital file, 1:24,000-scale hydrographic features were digitized off of USGS base maps. Index numbers, stream classes, and stream locations were checked by DWQ using plots generated by CGIA. The linework is tiled to 1:100,000-scale map extents and stored in a digital library. These files are updated as needed.</procdesc>

                <procdesc>100k hydrography was obtained for North Carolina from the Geographic Information &amp; Analysis. 40 1:100,000 quadrangle tiles were imported to ArcView. Tiles were exported as .dbf files to FoxPro. A statewide FoxPro database was created. 305(b) data was obtained as an EXCEL spreadsheet from DWQ and converted to FoxPro. The 305(b) spreadsheet was joined to the hydrography data by index# using FoxPro. Shapefile created in ArcView and exported to ArcInfo. The ArcInfo file was supplied to NC CGIA for final editing.</procdesc>

                <procdesc>The statewide 100k hydrography tiles were edgematched and mapjoined. The neatlines were removed and the coverage clipped to the North Carolina State boundary. This file was then clipped to the 17 river basins. Each river basin was edited such that index numbers matched. Attributes were re-named and edited in cooperation with DWQ. GIA updates the digital files as needed.</procdesc>

            <eaover>A polygon coverage depicting surface waters consisting of streams and rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and shorelines. The arc attribute table (AAT) arc length (linear meters), polygon internal identification number, polygon user identification number, a DWQ internal index number that relates to the identification of the stream, the stream's use support rating, the classification of the surface water, the river basin name, the name of the stream, the date the feature was last classified, the name of the USGS 1:100,000-scale river basin on which the feature is located, two DLG standard feature codes, and a CGIA feature type.
