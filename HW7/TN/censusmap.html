<h1>Homework 7: Census Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Robert Harlan</h2>
<h3>This map shows the number of individuals living below the poverty line per county in the state of Tennessee. The lighter and white colored counties have relatively low poverty rates, and the darker counties have higher rates. While there are many counties across the state that are in the highest group of impoverished individuals, counties in the eastern part of the state in the Appalachain mountains have the most consistently high poverty rates. This data set is interesting because it shows the number of individuals that are below the poverty line, wheras many data sets only show the number of households below the poverty line.</h3>
